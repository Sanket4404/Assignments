Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following: D 100 W 200 (Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative. Write functions for withdraw and deposit) D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
D 300, D 300 , W 200, D 100 Then, the output should be: 500



bal = int(input("Enter opening balance : "))

def deposit(amt):
amt=int(input("Enter deposite amount:"))
global bal
fin = bal
fin = fin + amt
bal = fin
return bal
def withdraw(amt):
amt=int(input("Enter withdrawal amount:"))
global bal
fin = bal
if bal <= amt:
print(" \nInsufficient Funds!!!")
print("Transaction Unsuccessful")
else:
fin = fin - amt
bal = fin
print(" \nTransaction Successful")
return bal
while True:
sum = 0
print()
a = input("Enter command : ")
if a == "exit" or a == "EXIT":
print("\nFinal balance is : ", bal)
exit()
else:

for i in range(1, len(a)):
if a[i].isdigit() == True:
sum = sum * 10 + int(a[i])
else:
print("Invalid!!!")
break
if a[0] == "D":
bal = deposit(sum)
print(" \nTransaction Successful")
print("Balance is : ", bal)
elif a[0] == "W":
bal = withdraw(sum)
print("Balance is : ", bal)
else:
print("Invalid Command!!! \n")
